flydra_viz -- Visualization tools for the Flydra tracking system.


N.B., this project is under active development, so be sure to look at
the code, or email Scott Livingston if the notes below are out-of-date
or incorrect.

nodes/flydra2rviz.py reads tracked objects (i.e. points) from a Flydra
mainbrain server (visible as a ROS topic) and forwards them as Markers
on topic visualization_marker, all within the namespace ``tracked_points''.
The points can then be viewed in RViz ( http://www.ros.org/wiki/rviz
), or anything that accepts visualization_msgs/Marker messages.
